# Welcome to the Programming Challenges repository! 

This repository is a collection of programming exercises aimed at improving your problem-solving abilities, with a focus on daily coding challenges and job interview scenarios. The challenges are language-agnostic, meaning they can be solved in any programming language of your choice â€” from Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, ASM, and more.

## About the Challenges
The challenges in this repository are designed to help you:

    - Sharpen your logic: Enhance your understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
    - Prepare for coding interviews: Tackle problems you might face in real-world job interviews.
    - Practice with any language: Feel free to use any programming language you're comfortable with or wish to learn.

## Topics Covered
The challenges will cover a variety of topics, including:

    - Algorithms: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.
    - Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
    - Mathematical Problems: Some challenges include basic math and logic puzzles.
    - Interview-style Problems: Simulate real coding interview questions that test your problem-solving and coding abilities.

## Challenge Frequency

    - New Challenges Weekly: I aim to publish at least 3 new challenges per week. The challenges will be released every Sunday.
    - Varied Difficulty: The problems will range from beginner to intermediate levels, with more advanced problems coming in the future.
