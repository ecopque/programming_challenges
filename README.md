# Welcome to the Programming Challenges repository! 

This repository is a collection of programming exercises designed to enhance your problem-solving skills, with a focus on daily coding challenges and job interview scenarios. While many challenges are presented in their original form, some have been adapted or modified by me to introduce new perspectives and variations. Nevertheless, full credit is given to the original creators of the challenges. Challenges signed by me are entirely my own creations.

All exercises are language-agnostic and can be solved using any programming language of your choice â€” including Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, ASM, and more. To learn more about the original developers of each challenge, please refer to the folder corresponding to each exercise in this repository.

## About the Challenges
The challenges in this repository are designed to help you:

- Sharpen your logic: Enhance your understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
- Prepare for coding interviews: Tackle problems you might face in real-world job interviews.
- Practice with any language: Feel free to use any programming language you're comfortable with or wish to learn.

## Topics Covered
The challenges will cover a variety of topics, including:

- Algorithms: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.
- Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
- Mathematical Problems: Some challenges include basic math and logic puzzles.
- Interview-style Problems: Simulate real coding interview questions that test your problem-solving and coding abilities.

## Challenge Frequency

- New Challenges Weekly: I aim to publish at least 3 new challenges per week. The challenges will be released every Sunday.
- Varied Difficulty: The problems will range from beginner to intermediate levels, with more advanced problems coming in the future.
