# Welcome to the Programming Challenges repository! 

This repository is a collection of programming exercises designed to enhance your problem-solving skills, with a focus on daily coding challenges and job interview scenarios. While many challenges are presented in their original form, some have been adapted or modified by me to introduce new perspectives and variations. Nevertheless, full credit is given to the original creators of the challenges. Challenges signed by me are entirely my own creations.

All exercises are language-agnostic and can be solved using any programming language of your choice â€” including Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, ASM, and more. 

To learn more about the original developers of each challenge, please refer to the folder corresponding to each exercise in this repository.
